This  is   a  Vire  demonstrator  setup   representing  the  SuperNEMO
demonstrator experiment as  a toy model for  Vire software components.
In a  near future,  this hierarchy  will be  used as  the base  of the
official description of the SuperNEMO demonstrator experiment from the
Falaise software environment.

For now, we use it as a realistic use case for the Vire system.
