//! \brief   Utilities for accessing Vire plugin apps and libraries
//! \details The Vire library accepts several plugin apps and libraries
//!
//!          As these files are not compiled into the Vire library,
//!          Vire provides a simple API to get a path to known
//!          plugin DLL.
