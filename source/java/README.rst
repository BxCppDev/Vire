============================
Vire Java Payload API
============================

This directory  contains a  collection of classes  ported to  the Java
language from the  C++ API. This consists in a  minimal set of objects
that   can   be  transmitted   between   remote   components  of   the
control/monitoring system.

It is a very preliminary  work. It does not contains utilities/methods
to automate  the import/export of  theses classes to  Protobuf message
objects.   Also  only  the   classes  from  the  ``Vire/utility``  and
``Vire/message``   are  implemented.    Only   a   few  classes   from
``Vire/cms`` are provided.
